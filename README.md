App Name: Coin Clash

Core Concept:

Coin Clash is a multiplayer betting game where users challenge each other in real-time rounds of "Eagle or Reshka." Players can place bets in Telegram Stars or TON currency, and the winner takes the bank while the platform takes a 10% commission. The twist? Players can choose from 5 unique betting modes that add strategy and excitement to the game.

Key Features:

Multiplayer Mode:
Users can challenge friends or random opponents in real-time.
Each round consists of two players: one chooses "Eagle," the other "Reshka."
A virtual coin flip determines the winner.
5 Unique Betting Modes:
Classic Mode: Standard 50/50 odds. Bet on heads or tails.
Double or Nothing: Bet double your initial stake for a chance to win 2x the pot.
Streak Mode: Predict multiple coin flips in a row (e.g., 3 heads in a row). Higher risk, higher reward.
Team Mode: Two teams of players bet against each other. The winning team splits the pot.
Blind Bet: Place a bet without knowing which side (Eagle or Reshka) youâ€™re choosing. The odds are randomized, but the payout is higher.
In-App Currency:
Users can bet using Telegram Stars or TON cryptocurrency.
The platform takes a 10% commission from each winning pot.
Leaderboard and Rewards:
A global leaderboard ranks players based on their winnings.
Weekly tournaments with special prizes (e.g., bonus Telegram Stars or TON).
Social Interaction:
Players can send taunts, emojis, or quick messages during the game.
Invite friends to play and earn referral bonuses.
Provably Fair System:
Use blockchain-based randomness (e.g., TON smart contracts) to ensure fair coin flips.
Players can verify the fairness of each round.
Customizable Avatars:
Users can create and customize their avatars using in-game currency or Telegram Stars.
Daily Challenges:
Complete daily challenges (e.g., "Win 3 rounds in a row") to earn bonus rewards.
